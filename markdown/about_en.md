<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="4">Later, I made a chat room website with a script and then I got to know some developers, whose job was to develop chat rooms and forums sites. They accepted me as a graphic designer and support operator in their team despite my young age, until they developed a custom-built script that had a strong management panel.<br>
We made a lot of progress and took over 90% of the chat room website market. We were at the peak of progress when filtering due to the promotion of corruption. The team fell apart because of this issue. I hated the Net and went to C# to work on Windows software applications.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">I became interested in university, and after university, I was familiar with accounting due to the development of the financial management and accounting section that was written in most of the software in C# that i worked on, so I accepted the accounting position at KristalPars Company.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">After about two years, I came to the conclusion that nothing can take the place of programming for me, and then started as a self-taught front-end professional for two-years , and now I work as a freelancer.</p>
